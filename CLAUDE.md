# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Typescript**: Use strict typing with proper interfaces and types
- **Components**: Follow atomic design pattern (atom, ui, modal folders)
- **Naming**: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- **Styling**: Use tailwind with the `cn()` utility for class composition
- **React**: Use functional components with proper typing for props
- **UI Components**: Follow existing patterns in component variants and theming
